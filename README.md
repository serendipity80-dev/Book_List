# Add _a_ Book

Add _a_ Book ia a simple project that we build as a task within JavaScript(ES6) Module. In this simple application we can add as well as remove favorite authors, books and ISBN#. Every time we add or remove a favorite book from the table list, the alert disappears after 3s. The app is also responsive with boilerplate Skeleton.
